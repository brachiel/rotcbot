rotcbot - Jabber bot that scans the TGE master server and announces new games of a specific type.
In this case rotc - Revenge of the Cast.

Create a config file in
~/.rotcbot_jabber
and fill it with these options:
username = <user>@<jabber-server>
password = <password>
control_room = <room>@<conference-jabber-server>

The last option is optional.

The bot is used by either starting
$ python rotcbot_jabber.py
or 
$ python rotcbot_jabber_supervisor.py

The supervisor script restarts the bot if something happens, and reports the errors to
the control room.
